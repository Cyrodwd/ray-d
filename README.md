# ray-d
------
[`Raylib`](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) v5.5-dev dynamic bindings for Dlang!
New Dlang binding for the latest new version of Raylib. This
binding also includes [`raygui`](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui).
## Usage
Before using it, you must make sure you have Raylib installed on your system. Since raylib 5.5-dev does not have a release available, you must compile it from [source code](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux).

## Build
-------
You can simply run this `dub` command in your terminal/cmd:
```bash
dub build
```

## Example
You can see the [demo](demo/) directory which demonstrates a basic application made
with ray-d.
